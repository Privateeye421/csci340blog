I would like to start by saying that I'm really glad we decided to go over the lab on Monday. Otherwise,
I might have picked a more complicated style: [Jasper][link1] was looking pretty tempting!

My only big problem I had making the changes was trying to find everything. I had to dig through all of
the HTML files to try and find whatever was causing my home page to display the word "Subscribe" so that
I could get rid of it. Also, since this entire thing was new to me, I had a bad habit of overthinking
how things were supposed to be done.

I'm not really sure about how the website is going to handle all of the gem stuff that's on my computer,
so I might need to move some of the Long Haul directories into my project. Still, though this felt pretty
good to actually get done! I still don't really understand include all that well, specifically how
to make custom stuff for the website in it, but I suppose that will all come with time.

While I didn't end up using anything from most of the searches I made to try and work stuff out, I do
have to credit the [Jekyll website][link2] for helping me figure out how to put images in my blog post.
