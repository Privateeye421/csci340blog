My name is Jack Frey. I'm 20 years old. I go to school at Hendrix College. My apartment is in
Market Square North, where all of the restaurants are, and I get home at 4 P.M. at the latest.
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not
to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep
at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
